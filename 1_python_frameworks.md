### Python web frameworks

#### Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework optimal for building small, simple web applications or for prototyping ideas quickly. Flask supports core web server functionality such as routing & request handling, templating, static files, and database integration.

#### Django

Django is a full-featured web framework designed to help developers build large, complex data-drive web applications as quickly as possible. It includes a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for working with databases, a template engine for rendering HTML, and support for web sockets. 

Django has a large community of 3rd-party tools to support caching, request handling, background operations, authentication, and other essential functionality.

#### Async Frameworks

A number of **asynchronous** Python-based web framework can handle multiple requests concurrently, similar to a Node.js application. Some widely used async frameworks are:

- [Aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
- [Quart](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/)
