### Summary

Python is increasingly popular for powering data-driven services and web applications. 

This course will cover modern Python technologies and techniques for *backend* web development with a focus on data-driven sites. By quarter's end, students have built a fully-functional client-server application they can showcase for job applications.

### Requirements

Students should have experience with basic Python syntax, web development skills, and database design/querying, via IT 111 or comparable experience, including:

- HTML and CSS
- HTTP request/response methods
- SQL and relational database terminology
- Python language syntax

Students will perform extensive hands-on development throughout the course and will require;

- A computer onto which they can install software,
- A working internet connection
- A syntax-highlighting text editor
- A https://github.com account

This course will use **Web Development with Django** as a textbook, as well as supplementary online materials.

Students can access this textbook free online through https://libguides.seattlecentral.edu/az.php?a=o using these steps:

- Select “O’Reilly for Education”
- In the ‘Select institution’ drop-down menu, select “not listed”
- Create new account (first time) using your *@seattlecolleges.edu* email address.

### Class Structure and Topics

Course instruction will be fully online with Zoom conference at scheduled class times to review new material, answer questions, and resolve any issues with completing the homework.

Throughout the week, students can reach me directly in the SCC tutoring Slack team with questions.

Each week, we'll cover a new topic, building on the previous week's work. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Python web franeworks overview - e.g. Flask, Django, aiohttp, etc.
- Web application structures - routes, views, templates, and static files
- UI templating 
- REST APIs
- Database integration
- Using Docker for development
- Unit testing
- Asynchronous Python operations
- Deploying to a public web server

Each Monday, you'll be given an assignment to test what you've picked up on that week's topic. Assignments are due by the end-of-day Sunday of that week. Assignments will build on each other toward a completed final project.

Most of your grade will come from turning in assignments on time and showing that you tried to solve it using your own original work. Your homework should be completely your own: plagiarism and late submissions may incur a grade penalty.

Homework assignments should be submitted in Canvas as links to your github.com repository. You should use a **single repository and branch** throughout the course, with clear a 'commit' message for each assignment completion.
