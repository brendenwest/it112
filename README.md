### Summary

Python is increasingly popular for powering data-driven services and web applications. 

This course will cover modern Python technologies and techniques for *backend* web development with a focus on data-driven sites. By quarter's end, students have built a fully-functional client-server application they can showcase for job applications.

### Learning Outcomes
- Python development practices
- Python web frameworks & application architecture
- Unit & integration testing
- REST APIs
- Database integration & ORMs
- Application containerization

### Requirements

Students should have some familiarity with the following:

- HTML and CSS
- HTTP request/response methods
- Linux command-line operations
- SQL and relational database terminology
- Python language syntax

Students will perform extensive hands-on development throughout the course and will require;

- A computer onto which they can install software,
- A working internet connection
- A syntax-highlighting text editor (e.g. IntelliJ or VSCode)
- A https://github.com account
- A https://datacamp.com account

This course will use **Web Development with Django, 2nd**, as well as supplementary online materials.

Students can access this text free online through  https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/?orpq using these steps:

- In the ‘Select institution’ drop-down menu, select “not listed”
- Create new account (first time) using your *@seattlecolleges.edu* email address.

### Class Structure and Topics

Course instruction will be on-campus at scheduled class times to review new material, answer questions, and resolve any issues with completing the homework.

Throughout the week, students can reach me directly via Canvas or email with questions.

Each week, we'll cover a new topic, building on the previous week's work. This course covers the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Python language syntax & command-line operations
- git source control
- Python package management
- Python web frameworks overview - e.g. Flask, Django, aiohttp, etc.
- Web application structures - routes, views, and static files
- UI templates
- REST APIs
- Database integration
- Using Docker containers
- Unit testing
- Asynchronous Python operations
- Deploying to a public web server

Each Monday, you'll be given an assignment to test what you've picked up on that week's topic. Assignments are due by the end-of-day Sunday of that week. Assignments will build on each other toward a completed final project.

-  There is a **10% penalty for late assignments up to 2 weeks late**
-  Assignments turned in later than 2+ weeks **will not be accepted** nor graded
-  At the instructor's sole discretion, and with prior approval from the instructor, an assignment may be turned in late under mitigating circumstances such as a medical emergency or work travel.

Most of your grade will come from turning in assignments on time and showing that you tried to solve it using your own original work. Plagiarism (including work produced by generative AI) may incur a grade penalty.

Homework assignments should be submitted in Canvas, typically as links to your github.com repository. You should use a **single github.com repository and branch** throughout the course, with clear a 'commit' message for each assignment completion.

### Grading

Final grades are on a 4-point scale and determined based the percentage of total points achieved.
